# Digital-Timer
Embedded custom single-purpose processor implemented in a Xilinx Spartan 3A FPGA fabric that controls a digital timer in which the user can set a time between 1 second to 10 minutes.

## Project Objectives
* Implement a digital timer with three hexadecimal displays
* Allow user to specify the timer duration from 1 second to 10 minutes using push buttons
* Light up all the FPGA onboard LEDs to tell the user that the specified time has elapsed
* Provide reset functionality using a Reset push button
