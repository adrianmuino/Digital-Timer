# Digital-Timer
Embedded custom single-purpose processor implemented in a Xilinx Spartan 3A FPGA fabric that controls a digital timer in which the user can set a time between 1 second to 10 minutes.
## Project Objectives:
• Implement a digital timer with three hexadecimal displays
• Allow user to specify the timer duration from 1 second to 10 minutes using push buttons
• Light up all the FPGA onboard LEDs to tell the user that the specified time has elapsed
• Provide reset functionality using a Reset push button
